=== Remote Process Calls

Again a library to implement RPC. The library will creates a layer to connect several RPC frameworks and technics.

To execute a RPC a client and server side is needed. The server
side provides the procedure and the client calls the procedure.

The framework also contains ways to announce the existing
procedures from servers to the client. In this way the
client should not know about how to call a RPC. The transport layer
behind calling can be changed without changing the client application.

On server side the publisher will publish known procedures
to a register (o.a.) and on client side the discovery will
collect the information.

=== Features

* Every node can be client and server in the same time
* Providing services with 'mhus operations' is a default feature

=== Possibilities

* The same operation with same UUID could be accessible by different providers, e.g. rest and local
